      Put simply, graphic design is the art and craft of creating visual content that communicates a concept, an idea or a brand message to the public. Logos, artworks, drawings, illustrations, cards, emails and a whole paraphernalia of designs are all around us. You can see them in print and digital media, in shops, restaurants and cafes, on billboards, books and magazines, in the apps we use, the sites we visit and the physical and digital products we buy. In fact, graphic design is a type of communication medium which uses visual means to convey a message. Designers use different types of physical materials or software to combine images, graphics and text as the main forms of expressing this message. Graphic design is used to sell, to build brand identity or to move people towards specific actions. It is also a form of art but ultimately, the different elements of the graphic representation influence our perceptions and emotions. There are different types of graphic design such as ‘visual identity’ which deals with the visual elements of the brand via shapes, colors and images (e.g. logo design, typography, brand style guides) and ‘marketing and advertising’ which is used directly to generate leads and sales via print (billboards, brochures, flyers, print ads) or digital (social media posts, banners, videos). There are many other types such as website design, industrial and product design, fashion design, book and illustrations, motion graphics design used for example by streamers or in gaming design and many others.
